    "\n",
    "Chemical structures are the visual language of chemistry. Chemists communicate molecular structures through standardized drawings that represent atoms, bonds, and spatial arrangements. However, translating between hand-drawn structures and computer-readable formats presents significant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variability in Drawing Styles**: Different chemists may draw the same molecule with variations in bond lengths, angles, and atom placements.\n",
    "2. **Complexity of Representation**: Chemical structures can range from simple linear molecules to complex polycyclic compounds with multiple functional groups.\n",
    "3. **Standardization Requirements**: For computational analysis, structures must be converted to standardized formats like SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System).\n",

    "\n",
    "Sketchem is a molecular pictionary game that combines the fun of drawing games with the educational value of learning chemical structures. It serves multiple purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Educational Tool**: Helps students learn to draw and memorize chemical structures\n",
    "2. **AI's Capabilities**: Displays the power of multimodal models and how they can be put to good use.\n",

    "Sketchem is built using a modern web application stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Frontend**: Streamlit for the user interface and interactive elements\n",
    "2. **Drawing Interface**: Streamlit-drawable-canvas for the molecular drawing canvas\n",
    "3. **AI Integration**: Google's Gemini API for image recognition and SMILES generation\n",
    "4. **Chemical Processing**: RDKit for molecular validation and visualization\n",

    "### Chemistry Education\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactive Learning**: Makes learning chemical structures more engaging and encourages repeated practice through competition\n",
    "2. **Immediate Feedback**: Helps students correct their mistakes quickly using almost-instantaneous feedback called \"Hints\"\n",
    "3. **Close to Real Life**: Our idea behind using a canvas-based drawing platform instead of the typical bond / atom molecule drawing packages was its similarity to how one would draw molecules on paper; and we strongly believe our canvas-based approach is optimized for a proper learning experience\n",
    "\n",
    "But Sketchem is also a POC (proof of concept) for the use of AIs such as Gemini for molecule recognition:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rapid Digitization**: Our code could be reused and perfected to create a tool like DECIMER that allows researchers to quickly digitize hand-drawn ideas, but without the cumbersome aspect of ML models nor the wait times associated with using ML-based packages like DECIMER.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Single-Player Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Same but Better**: The singleplayer option offers all of the options of the multiplayer one, except YOU choose your own pace and what you want to work on \n",
    "2. **Validation & Feedback**: Just like for the multiplayer option, you can choose to receive immediate feedback on your drawing accuracy using the \"Hint\" option\n",

    "## 💻 Challenges & How We Handled Them\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the project, our biggest challenge was figuring out how to manage the data for all the Sketchem players. The idea of storing, organizing, and tracking such a large amount of information felt overwhelming. We initially considered using **Firebase / Firestore** (Google's game-oriented database service), which is a cloud-based database. Instead, we quickly realized that Streamlit only runs one instance of every package (for everyone that accesses the website) when it is hosted on its platform Streamlit Cloud. We thus took advantage of that to create a \"mock\" database which would be stored in a dictionary inside of a python file of our project and would constantly be updated according to the user interactions with the website. This way, we didn't need to maintain an external database, which made things much simpler and helped us avoid extra workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we worked through the project and started developing our ideas, we ran into another big challenge: molecule recognition. Initially, we wanted to use **Decimer** to convert the hand-drawn molecules into SMILES and determine whether the drawing was correct. Although Decimer was incredibly accurate when we tested it locally, we faced several issues including long waiting times (close to 7 minutes for some molecules) and issues with running the ML model on the Streamlit Cloud platform (over-allocation of resources). This pushed us to look for another solution, and that's when we found **Google's Gemini**. Since LLMs are trained on huge amounts of data, our idea was that Gemini would be an ideal contender for Decimer. After switching to Gemini, many issues such as long wait times and allocation limits were fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the slight improvement with Gemini, the switch from a dedicated ML-based package to a more generic LLM led to other issues such as uneven accuracy and difficulty in adjusting prompts to fit our needs. Not all correctly drawn molecules were recognized, and occasionally, false drawings were marked as correct. Unfortunately, no solution was found for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue arose when we decided to use Gemini for automatic category creation. As expected, Gemini's managed to create categories of molecules linked to a specific word or sentence really accurately. However, it really lagged behind when it came to finding the appropriate SMILES for the molecules in these categories. To improve this, we had the idea to connect Gemini to **PubChem**, a specialized chemistry database. This ensured all the generated SMILES were correct and didn't cause any additional issues later during the molecule recognition process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For building the web application, we chose **Streamlit** because it's a simple tool for creating web apps. It worked well for developing the core functionality of our project without much trouble. However, Streamlit’s simplicity meant that customizing the layout and formatting was harder than we expected. The default design didn’t meet our expectations, and it often resulted in a very plain user interface. This ended up costing us more time than we had planned. Still, we were able to make the best of it by customizing the layout as much as possible using custom div IDs from the deployed HTML code of the app, and we even created different versions of the web app depending on whether the user was on a phone or a computer.\n"
