Using advanced image recognition, Sketchem can identify hand-drawn molecular structures and convert them into standardized SMILES notation. But Sketchem doesn't doe just that. Whether you're a chemistry student learning to draw structures, a researcher sketching molecules, or simply interested in the intersection of chemistry and computer vision, this notebook provides insights into how Sketchem works and the problems it solves.\n",

The idea of storing, organizing, and tracking such a large amount of information felt overwhelming. We initially considered using **Firebase / Firestore** (Google's game-oriented database service), which is a cloud-based database. Instead, we quickly realized that Streamlit only runs one instance of every package (for everyone that accesses the website) when it is hosted on its platform Streamlit Cloud. We thus took advantage of that to create a \"mock\" database which would be stored in a dictionary inside of a python file of our project and would constantly be updated according to the user interactions with the website. This way, we didn't need to maintain an external database, which made things much simpler and helped us avoid extra workload.\n",

                                "As we worked through the project and started developing our ideas, we ran into another big challenge: molecule recognition. Initially, we wanted to use **Decimer** to convert the hand-drawn molecules into SMILES and determine whether the drawing was correct. Although Decimer was incredibly accurate when we tested it locally, we faced several issues including long waiting times (close to 7 minutes for some molecules) and issues with running the ML model on the Streamlit Cloud platform (over-allocation of resources). This pushed us to look for another solution, and that's when we found **Google's Gemini**. Since LLMs are trained on huge amounts of data, our idea was that Gemini would be an ideal contender for Decimer. After switching to Gemini, many issues such as long wait times and allocation limits were fixed. \n",

Not all correctly drawn molecules were recognized, and occasionally, false drawings were marked as correct. Unfortunately, no solution was found for this.\n",

As expected, Gemini's managed to create categories of molecules linked to a specific word or sentence really accurately. However, it really lagged behind when it came to finding the appropriate SMILES for the molecules in these categories. To improve this, we had the idea to connect Gemini to **PubChem**, a specialized chemistry database. This ensured all the generated SMILES were correct and didn't cause any additional issues later during the molecule recognition process.\n",

It worked well for developing the core functionality of our project without much trouble. However, Streamlit’s simplicity meant that customizing the layout and formatting was harder than we expected. The default design didn’t meet our expectations, and it often resulted in a very plain user interface. This ended up costing us more time than we had planned. Still, we were able to make the best of it by customizing the layout as much as possible using custom div IDs from the deployed HTML code of the app, and we even created different versions of the web app depending on whether the user was on a phone or a computer.\n"
