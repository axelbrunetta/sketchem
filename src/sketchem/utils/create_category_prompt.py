# This file contains the prompt for the Gemini AI to generate a new molecule category


def create_prompt(user_prompt):
    return f"""
Generate a list of molecule names that fit most accurately a category described by : "{user_prompt}".

Please provide 5-15 molecule names (except if a number was provided in the "text" from before, in which case use that one for the number of molecules).

Output Format:
Provide your response as a simple list of molecule names, each on a new line. Do NOT include SMILES notation, category names, the number of molecules, or any other text.

Category Name
Molecule 1 Name
Molecule 2 Name
...

For example, if the category was "Common Alcohols":
Common Alcohols
Methanol
Ethanol
Isopropanol

Or if the category was "Halogenated Solvents":
Halogenated Solvents
Chloroform
Dichloromethane

IMPORTANT Rules to Follow for Molecule Name Selection and Output:

1.  Names and Category Only: Your entire output should be the category name (without number of molecules) followed by a list of molecule names, each on a new line. Do not include ANY other explanations, commentary, or SMILES strings.
2.  Real Molecules Only: DO NOT invent molecules or use molecules that do not exist in real life (e.g., do NOT use ones that exist in movies or stories, or are fictional / imaginary). Use common, well-established chemical names.
3.  Do not add anything to the chemical names (e.g. don't write the name then something in parentheses next to it to justify the choice of that molecule)
4.  Simple Structures: Focus on molecules that can be easily represented by simple chemical structures (suitable for hand drawing). Avoid names that refer to:
    *   DNA, RNA
    *   Graphite, Diamond (extended covalent networks), Graphite, Graphene, ...
    *   Alloys
    *   Fullerenes, Carbon nanotubes, Buckyballs
    *   Complex / Very Large Proteins or Polymers
5.  Molecules, Not Atoms: Do NOT output names of elemental atoms only. Do NOT output things like:

6.  Category Interpretation: Be lenient on the category descriptions. If the description is vague, try to find molecule names related to that description (even if distantly related) while still respecting all aforementioned rules.
7.  Clarity of Names: Try to use names that are likely to be found in chemical databases like PubChem (e.g., common names or IUPAC names). Avoid overly obscure or ambiguous names.
